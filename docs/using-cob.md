# Using COB

## External Ontology developers guide

It is too early for you to start using COB as an upper level in your ontology

 1. Create a [*base* file](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/ReleaseArtefacts.md#release-artefact-1-base-required)
 2. Add bridging axioms to your root to [cob-to-external.tsv](cob-to-external.tsv)
 3. Add your ontology to the Makefile under integration tests
