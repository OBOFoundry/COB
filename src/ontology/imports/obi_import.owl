It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:

1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch
editor), with individual persons as bearers

2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)

3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles
there are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the
charter/rules/bylaws themselves.

It is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent
continuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the
bearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define
organization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to
all kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.

Interestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place
organization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,
Government Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,
W3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.

This leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -
3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its
current place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to
'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue
for now."@en)

Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement."@en)

Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily."@en)

This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm.

The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column.

Evoked by many exciting applications, there is a need for analytical methods which require less amounts of sample. Bruker BioSpin meets this challenge with a revolutionary NMR probe design: The 1mm MicroProbe. It operates with disposable 1mm capillary sample tubes and the sample volume of 5 microliters enables the use of lowest amounts of sample to run all high resolution NMR experiments with outstanding sensitivity and up to 16 times faster measurements. Due to the TXI-type probe design, the z-gradient coil and the automatic matching and tuning accessory, the 1mm MicroProbe can be used for a wide variety of NMR experiments. The key advantages of this probe include:n   up to 4 times higher mass sensitivity than 5mm conventional probes (with respect to the same sample amount)n   excellent solvent suppression propertiesn   virtually no salt effectn   discrete samples in tubes that can be sealed and storedn   automation accessory for sample preparation and handling available."@en)

Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.

2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:

(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.

(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.

(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.

In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.")

In this system, a given transcription factor (TF) is expressed as a fusion to a subunit of RNA polymerase. In parallel, a library of randomized oligonucleotides representing potential TF target sequences, is cloned into a separate vector containing the selectable genes HIS3 and URA3. If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively. At the end of the process, positive clones are sequenced and examined with motif-finding tools in order to resolve the favoured DNA target sequence"@en)

The lamp consists of two electrodes typically made of tungsten which are separated by a gas. The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interrogation point."@en)
