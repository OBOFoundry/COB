This project is an attempt to bring together key terms from a wide range of [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO)](http://obofoundry.org) projects into a single, small ontology. The goal is to improve interoperabilty and reuse across the OBO community through better coordination of key terms. Our plan is to keep this ontology small, but ensure that one or more COB terms can be used as the root of any given OBO library ontology.
